            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>
                We're so excited that you've chosen to build with Orange Ribbon Bionics.

            <h3>Choosing a Project</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As a builder, you have the option to either assemble kits for users globally through our official project network or to request a kit on behalf of a local or individual connection.
                If opting to kickstart a new device per the latter route, you will be sent an initial prosthesis specification form.
                You may be asked to provide a range of bodily measurements as applicable depending on the intended model, so be sure to have access to this information prior to starting your request.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Assembling a Kit</h3>
            <p>
                Once you receive your kit, you can begin the assembly phase.
                The package you receive should contain a build guide tailored to your specific project.
                If you require further help or instruction, feel free to contact our team via email or telephone.
            </p>
